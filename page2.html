User interactions with false content rose steadily on both Facebook and Twitter through the end of 2016.  Since then, however, interactions with false content have fallen sharply on Facebook while continuing to rise on Twitter, with the ratio of Facebook engagements to Twitter shares decreasing by 60 percent.<br><br>In comparison, interactions with other news, business, or culture sites have followed similar trends on both platforms. The results suggest that Facebook’s efforts to limit the diffusion of misinformation after the 2016 election may have had a meaningful impact.<br></p>

                Public opinion regarding these findings:</span></h1>
            
            <p class="mbr-text align-left pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/09/facebook-fake-news-getting-better-study.html" target="_blank">This Slate article</a> reviews the findings of the Alcott, Gentzkow, and Yu study Stanford recently published. Although Oremus caution that the study is “far from definitive,” he notes it as perhaps the first large-scale empirical study that directly examines the efficacy of Facebook’s ongoing campaign against misinformation. <br><br>The study shows that “fake news” has declined more than 50 percent between the 2016 election and July 2018, using data tracked by the content marketing firm BuzzSumo. That result stands out when compared to the trends on Twitter, where retweets of the same sites rose significantly over the same time period. <br><br>That makes sense when you consider that Facebook has made a concerted effort to limit misinformation on its platform since early 2017, whereas Twitter has not. (Twitter’s enforcement efforts have focused on bots, spam, harassment, and hate speech, not false news stories.) This indicates that Facebook’s apparent gains are not simply a result of fake news sites giving up, winding down their operations, or changing their domain names.</p>

                <blockquote>“It would be a mistake, however, to conclude that Facebook has solved its misinformation problem, or that Twitter’s is worse. According to the study’s methodology, the scale of the problem on Facebook was much greater to begin with, and remains much greater today. The ratio of Facebook engagements to Twitter retweets on the 570 sites has fallen from about 40-to-1 to about 15-to-1, which implies that <strong>Facebook is still by far the larger fake news source.</strong> And the sites included in the study are still racking up some 70 million Facebook engagements per month. That’s far less than the 200 million per month they were receiving at the height of the 2016 election, but it’s still an awful lot.”</blockquote>

                            We learned that dispelling misinformation is challenging. Just because something is marked as “false” or “disputed” doesn’t necessarily mean we will be able to change someone’s opinion about its accuracy. In fact, some research suggests that strong language or visualizations (like a bright red flag) can backfire and further entrench someone’s beliefs.

                        <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                            Disputed flags were only applied after two third-party fact-checking organizations determined an article was false because it was a strong visual signal and we wanted to set a high bar for where we applied it. Requiring two false ratings slowed down our ability to provide additional context and often meant that we weren’t able to do so at all. This is particularly problematic in countries with very few fact-checkers, where the volume of potentially false news stories and the limited capacity of the fact-checkers made it difficult for us to get ratings from multiple fact-checkers.

                        <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                            Some of our fact-checking partners use a range of ratings. For example, they might use “false,” “partly false,” “unproven,” and “true.” We only applied Disputed flags to “false” ratings because it was a strong visual signal, but people wanted more context regardless of the rating. There are also the rare circumstances when two fact-checking organizations disagree about the rating for a given article. Giving people all of this information can help them make more informed decisions about what they read, trust, and share.

                My reactions to this article:</span></h1>
            
            <p class="mbr-text align-left pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">While I am happy that the design team is spearheading this fight against misinformation, I have some issues in the context of the theories I posited in the earlier section of this project.<br><br>Namely, I see that the flagging system does align well as preventative measures, it is explicitly tied to fact checking. Fact checking simply cannot keep up with the pace at which disinformation moves and ultimately does not prevent or limit CIE. I assume that this is the best they can do, given the first ammendment and that Facebook is a social media site, not a publisher.&nbsp;<br><br>My immediate reation is "is this enough?" I personally do not see the employment of fact checking to be efficient in a completely peripheral realm. Information moves to quickly to get everything fact checked, let alone through two different third parties.&nbsp;</p>
